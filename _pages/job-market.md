title: What kinds of jobs can I get with a Ph.D.?
author: Sachiko Matsumoto

With a Ph.D. in CS, you will qualified for a wide range of tech jobs, including
all of those that
you could get with a masters degree.  The data bears this out and shows that
the vast majority of Ph.D. graduates find employment after graduating.  The
([2019 Taulbee survey, Table D4]({% post_url 2021-03-10-Taulbee-Survey %}))
found that less than 1% of new Ph.D.s reported being unemployed, though 27% of
Ph.D.s employment status was unknown.  About 15% of participants had a postdoc
position (in industry or academia).  Other grads work in industry (59%),
academic positions (22%), and government (2%), as well as other types of
positions.

NC State has some published [some
data](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/academics/graduate/employment.php) about where
their Ph.D.s get jobs.  Duke has [some
data](https://public.tableau.com/shared/4W3RNW4K7?:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link&:embed=y&:showVizHome=no)
too.  I would expect numbers to be similar for other good Ph.D. programs.

## Jobs in Academia


There are many job opportunities for Ph.D.s.  Most of these jobs either require a
Ph.D. or take a long time to get without one.  For instance, most professorships
require a Ph.D. Similarly, if you want to lead a research team and guide projects
in industry, you may need a Ph.D..  Some people do a postdoc immediately after
graduating.  Otherwise, two useful categories for thinking about jobs are
academia and industry, though other options exist.

Within an academic track, there are several options.  Some people choose to
take teaching professorships, which focus on teaching rather than research.
Other positions, such as tenured or tenure-track positions, will focus more on
doing research.

## Jobs in Industry

With a Ph.D. you are qualified for any job that might requires an master
degree.  You will also have a "leg up" in jobs that involve key research skills
like seeing the big picture, identifying and framing important problems, and
communicating with others.

There are also industry jobs that generally require an Ph.D.  For instance,
some companies host research groups to do advance research and development.

In North America, around 57% of grads reported having research positions, and
around 31% reported having non-research positions.  Many large companies (like
Facebook, Google, Microsoft, etc.) have research divisions that hire Ph.D.s.
Some people also choose to work at smaller startups.

## What Job Should you Choose?

There are a few considerations when choosing between academic and industry
positions. Industry positions tend to have higher pay compared to academic
positions. For instance, pay in industry positions typically ranges from about
$90,000 for research scientists to $194,000 for chief data scientists
([data](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Degree=Doctorate_(PhD)%2C_Computer_Science_(CS)/Salary))
, with an average around
[$122,000](https://www.noodle.com/articles/how-much-will-you-make-with-a-phd-in-computer-science-earning-potential-salary-guide#:~:text=Salary.com%20reports%20an%20average,computer%20science%20PhDs%20of%20%24122%2C000).

Academic
pay typically ranges from around $72,000 for some instructors to $160,000 for
new full professors (note that salaries can vary a lot between institutions),
according to the Taulbee Survey, and [less than
10%](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Degree=Doctorate_(PhD)%2C_Computer_Science_(CS)/Salary)
of Ph.D. graduates end up with tenure-track positions.

Academic jobs are also pretty competitive.  In 2018-2019, there were 1,039 vacant
academic positions (including post-doc positions), whereas there were 1,860
Ph.D.s awarded in 2019.

## Will I Be Over-qualified with a Ph.D.?

No, at least not in a way that will hurt you.  There may be some hiring
managers who might feel this way, but on balance having a Ph.D. opens many more
doors than it closes.  The Ph.D. employment statistics in the Taulbee Survey
(above) make that pretty clear.  Also, you'd probably be bored doing those jobs.
