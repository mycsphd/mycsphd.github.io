Here's everything you need to attend the information session.

* The sli.do has two "rooms" -- one for each topic on a given day.  You can switch back and forth to see what's coming up.
* There are separate zoom links for each topic.
* The sli.do links will let you submit and/or upvote questions.
* You can move between the two zoom meetings as much as you like.
