title: Can you do a Ph.D. part time?
author: Steven Swanson
---

I haven't been able to find any data on this, but consensus among faculty I've
talked to is that it is possible but extraordinarily rare.  There are probably
a few reasons for this, among them:

1. Getting a Ph.D. takes a long time (4-7 years) when you are working at it full time.  Doing it part time would take, presumably, much longer.
2. Students [usually get paid]({% link _posts/2021-03-10-how-do-i-pay-for-a-phd.md %}) to do their Ph.D., so working is not as necessary.

Finally, as an advisor, I'd be hesitant to advise a Ph.D. student part-time.
The project they would be working is my project too, and I want to make
progress as quickly as possible.
