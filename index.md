# Whether, Why, and How to Get a Ph.D. in Computer Science

-------

This site collects information about the why and how of getting a Ph.D. in
computer science and closely related disciplines.

It was created by professors who advise Ph.D. students and curent
Ph.D. students.  The information should be useful to anyone compemplating a
pursuing a Ph.D. at a university in the United States or Canada.  It is a free
service of the Computer Science Department at the University of California in
San Diego, and it does not promote any particular school.

Our hope is that this information will be useful in deciding whether a Ph.D. is
right for you and in guiding you through the application process.

# Upcoming Information Sessions 

We have two [live information sessions](/upcoming-sessions) coming up in April.  You should come!

3. [Online information sessions]({{ site.baseurl }}/Category/5_info-session.md) -- Professors and Ph.D. students answer your questions, live!
4. [A Blog](_blog.html) with announcement and articles of interest.
2. [A YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChjPbPsBwexriAwcnHdJTGw) with interviews with current Ph.D. students, professors, and Ph.D.-holding computer scientists working industry.  
5. [Other Resources]({{ site.baseurl }}/Category/7_resource.md) -- There are many other good resoures about CS Ph.D.s.  We link to them throughout the site.
