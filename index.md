# What's this?

This site collects and provides information about the why and how of getting a Ph.D. in
computer science and closely related disciplines.

It was created by professors who advise Ph.D. students and current
Ph.D. students.  The information should be useful to anyone contemplating a Ph.D. at a 
university in the United States or Canada.  It is a free
service of the [Computer Science Department](http://cse.ucsd.edu) at the [University of California in
San Diego](http://ucsd.edu), and it does not promote any particular school.

Our hope is that this information will be useful in deciding whether a Ph.D. is
right for you and in guiding you through the application process.

<!--# Upcoming Information Sessions
