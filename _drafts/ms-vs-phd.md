A Ph.D. is about extend the boundary of human knowledge.  A master degrees is
about gaining deeper knowledge in a particular area of CS.

## What is a Ph.D.?

A Ph.D. provides the skills and an opportunity to develope new knowledge about
computer science and communicate that knowledge to others.  As you complete a
Ph.D., you will create something fundamentally new (or as researches say
"novel") that the world has never seen before.  And you will share with the
world what you learned in creating it by writing research papers and presenting
your work to others.

The process or creating new knowledge is called "research" and research is the
focus of a Ph.D.

### Why would I get one?

You should get a Ph.D. if all of these are true:

1.  You love computer science.
2.  You are vicerally excited about extending the reach of our collective understanding of computers.
3.  You want to work on hard, open-ended problems that no one has solved before.
4.  It supports your career plans.

I can't overstate the importance of loving computer science.  Getting a
Ph.D. is hard and it takes a long time.  If you don't love computer science or don't
really want to get a Ph.D., it is unlikely you will succeed or be happy as you
try.

You should not get a Ph.D. for the money: Starting salaries with a Ph.D. are
[27% higher](https://bit.ly/2PSKHga) with a Ph.D. than [with a
Masters](https://bit.ly/3ujG1yM), but you'll spend an additional 2-5 years in
school during earning quite a bit less than you would with an MS degree.

### What will I learn?

Getting a Ph.D. will teach you how to extend humankind's understanding of
computing.  In addition, you will learn a wide range of technical,
organizational, and communication skills.  This education goes far beyond a
masters degree in both breadth and depth.

Topics will include:

1.  Identifying and articulating gaps in humankind's understanding of computing (i.e., research questions).
	2.  Becoming a world expert in a small corner of computer science (e.g., by solving problems no one has solved before).
3.  Developing, exploring, and evaluating approaches to filling those gaps (i.e., answering research questions).
4.  Communicating what you have done and why it is important in both the written word (i.e., writing research papers) and verbally (i.e., by giving talks.)
5.  A deeper understanding of core computer science concepts (i.e., you'll take some courses).

The first two items sound grandiose, but they are accurate: If you complete a
Ph.D. program, you will accomplish both of these to some degree, since they are
the core of what being a successful researcher entails.  If you go on from your
Ph.D. to be a researchers, solving unsolved problems will be your day-to-day job.

Getting a Ph.D. will also make you a better implementor (item 3) and a better
communicator (item 4).  These are skills of great practcial value in and out of
academia, but they are, unfortunately, generally outside the scope of
undergraduate and masters programs.

### I'd Actually Extend Human Knowledge?  Really?

Yes, really.  Doing succcessful research means writing research papers, and
papers don't get published without a meaningful _novel contribution_, which is a
new piece of knowledge that paper presents.  

You will write (at least) several research papers while a Ph.D. student (in
collaboration with your advisor), hence you will make several novel
contributions to knowledge.

[Matt Might](http://matt.might.net) has a great [explanation of this in
pictures](http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/).


### What do I Do After I Graduate?

Any of a great many things, including a few jobs that almost always require a
Ph.D.: being a professor and being a professional researcher industry.

Ph.D.s are qualified for a wide range of technology jobs, including all of
those that you could get with a masters degree.  However, you'll have more
experience than someone with a fresh master's degree, better communication
skills, a deeper knowledge of computing, and a better ability to see the big
picture.

NC State has some published [some
data](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/academics/graduate/employment.php) about where
their Ph.D.s get jobs.  Duke has [some
data](https://public.tableau.com/shared/4W3RNW4K7?:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link&:embed=y&:showVizHome=no)
too.  I would expect numbers to be similar for other good Ph.D. programs.

I've heard some concerns that getting a Ph.D. might make you over-qualified for
some positions.  I supposed that might be true, but two things:

1.  Once you have a Ph.D., you'd probably be bored by those jobs.
2.  Ph.D.s are in high demand and the unemployment rate among new Ph.D.s is
    extremelly low ([2019 Taulbee survey, Table D4]({% post_url
    2021-03-10-Taulbee-Survey %})), so you'll probably be able to find a job.
	
### Who is Qualified to Get A Ph.D.?

Good (not necessarily great) students in CS or (event tangentially) related
fields who love computer science and who have enough discipline to work for a
long time on a problem that interests them.

You do not need to be genius to do research, and the vast majority of CS Ph.D.s
are not geniuses.  You need to curious, interested, and determined.

### How do I get one?

The core of a Ph.D. degree is learning to do research by doing research.  Over
the course of 4-7 years, will work on a variety of research projects and write
a number of research papers in close collaboration with your Ph.D. advisor.

During the first couple of years, you will also take roughly the same courses
you take to get an MS degree, but these are not your main focus.  They just
provide the understanding of current CS knowledge necessary for your to
generate new CS knowledge.

## What is a Master Degree?

The goal of a masters degree is to acquire both broader and deeper (in your
focus area) knowledge of CS.  You will explore the core of CS in more detail,
and will learn more of the current state-of-the-art.

### Why would I get one?

A masters degree can be a good choice if you enjoy school, want to learn more
CS, and would like to earn more money when you graduate: On average, [MS
graduates](https://bit.ly/3ujG1yM)
earn about 19% more than those with an [undergraduate
degree](https://bit.ly/3cJRqC0).
You will also be considered for jobs that requires the more specialized
knowledge and skills you acquire with an MS.

### What will I learn?

You will learn more computer science both in terms of breadth and depth.  The
curriculum for a masters degree usually includes both more advances versions of
courses you took as an undergrad (e.g., operating systems, theory, graphics,
compilers) and even more advanced courses in a focus area (e.g., systems,
databases, graphics).

If the program includes a thesis component, you will also get some experience
doing writing about and presenting your work.  A thesis may even include some
original research.

### Who is Qualified to Get A Masters?

To a first approximation, anyone who does passably well in their undergraduate
program.  There are many, many masters programs and many will admit almost
anyone who's willing to pay tuition.

### How do I get one?

Master's degrees are, in many ways a natural continuation and deepening of your
undergraduate education in CS.  The sturcture is similar: You take courses with
homeworks and exams.  In most programs, once you take enough courses, you get a
masters degree.  Some programs allow (as an option) or require you to produce a
masters thesis -- a write up a small research or implementation projects that
demonstrates your depth of knowledge in a particular area.

Masters degrees typically take two years to complete, and [94% of students
pay](https://mycsphd.github.io/2021/03/10/Taulbee-Survey.html) for their the MS
degree themselves.
